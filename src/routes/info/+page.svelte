		<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-4">About Sustainability Inc.</h1>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">Inspiration</h2>
		<p>
			Sustainability Inc. is inspired by games like <a
				class="text-blue-300"
				href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a
			>, where you sell cookies by clicking on them. Through this project, I wanted to use the
			popularity of this style of game to educate people on the carbon emissions of everyday items.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">What it does</h2>
		<p>
			In Sustainability Inc., you&#39;re the CEO of a small company that sells different products.
			The goal of the game is to see how much carbon emissions you are producing when selling each
			item to progress. The game is designed to be educational, so you can click on any item to
			learn more about it.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">How we built it</h2>
		<ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
			<li>Set up a new SvelteKit Project</li>
			<li>
				Import <a class="text-blue-300" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> and other dependencies
			</li>
			<li>
				Design and implement the UI
				<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
					<li>
						Some of the UI elements are variations of the <a
							class="text-blue-300"
							href="https://www.hyperui.dev/">HyperUI Components</a
						>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Implement the game logic, including buying and selling items</li>
			<li>Add the carbon emissions data</li>
			<li>
				Add a tutorial for people who are new to the game, including a cookie so you only see it
				once
			</li>
			<li>
				Make description pages for each item with more information, like:
				<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
					<li>What the item is, and what it&#39;s used for</li>
					<li>Information about the carbon emissions</li>
					<li>
						Other concerns about the item, like the use of child labor or the use of toxic chemicals
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">Challenges we ran into</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Different sources of carbon emissions data all had slightly different numbers, so I had to
				do a lot of research to find the most accurate numbers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Staying consistent with the style of the game while also sourcing images that I was legally
				allowed to use was a challenge. I ended up using a lot of images from <a
					class="text-blue-300"
					href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a
				>, which are all licensed under the
				<a class="text-blue-300" href="https://unsplash.com/license">Unsplash License</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">Accomplishments that we&#39;re proud of</h2>
		<p>
			Getting the game to work in addition to researching and implementing the carbon emissions data
			was a big accomplishment. I&#39;m also proud of the UI, which I think is very clean and easy
			to use.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">What we learned</h2>
		<p>
			I learned a lot about the carbon emissions of everyday items, and I learned a lot about the
			scale of difference between different items. I hope players of the game will learn a lot about
			the carbon emissions of everyday items as I did, and I hope they will be inspired to make more
			sustainable choices.
		</p>
		<h2 class="font-medium text-lg mt-4">What&#39;s next for Sustainability Inc.</h2>
		<p>
			I would like to add more items to the game, and I would like to add a way to compare your
			carbon emissions to the average person in your country. I would also like to move the page to
			a more permanent domain.
