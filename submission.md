## Inspiration

Sustainability Inc. is inspired by games like [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), where you sell cookies by clicking on them. Through this project, I wanted to use the popularity of this style of game to educate people on the carbon emissions of everyday items.

## What it does

Sustainability Inc. is a game where you sell items to make money. The goal of the game is to see how much carbon emissions you are producing when selling each item to progress. The game is designed to be educational, so you can click on any item to learn more about it.

## How we built it

1. Set up a new SvelteKit Project
2. Import [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and other dependencies
3. Design and implement the UI
   * Some of the UI elements are variations of the [HyperUI Components](https://www.hyperui.dev/)
4. Implement the game logic, including buying and selling items
5. Add the carbon emissions data
6. Add a tutorial for people who are new to the game, including a cookie so you only see it once
7. Make description pages for each item with more information, like:
   * What the item is, and what it's used for
   * Information about the carbon emissions
   * Other concerns about the item, like the use of child labor or the use of toxic chemicals

## Challenges we ran into

1. Different sources of carbon emissions data all had slightly different numbers, so I had to do a lot of research to find the most accurate numbers.
2. Staying consistent to the style of the game while also sourcing images that I had rights to use was a challenge. I ended up using a lot of images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), which are all licensed under the [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting the game to work in addition to researching and implementing the carbon emissions data was a big accomplishment. I'm also proud of the UI, which I think is very clean and easy to use.

## What we learned

I learned a lot about the carbon emissions of everyday items, and I learned a lot about the scale of difference between different items. I hope players of the game will learn a lot about the carbon emissions of everyday items like I did, and I hope they will be inspired to make more sustainable choices.

## What's next for Sustainability Inc.

I would like to add more items to the game, and I would like to add a way to compare your carbon emissions to the average person in your country. I would also like to move the page to a more permanent domain.
